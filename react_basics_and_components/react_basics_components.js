/*
• React is all about Components.
• This is because all UIs are made of components.
• Actually, watching further, it sounds like React is all about Components and component composition.
  • This allows for reusability and compartmentalization.
• React combines HTML, CSS and JS.
  • CSS is the least important part.
• React further allows you to define the target state, depending on different conditions, and this allows you to define what should show on the page, and what shouldn't.
  • All of this without explicitly telling the DOM what should show.
